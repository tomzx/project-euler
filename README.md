# Project Euler

This repository contains my solutions to some of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.

The goals are many:
* Study how to solve problems efficiently
* Understand problem constraints
* Analyze solutions computational complexity (time and space)
* Iterate over previous solutions
* Build a set of reusable tools
* Learn about mathematics and algorithms
